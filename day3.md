1.C-Programs are written using the text editor tools.
2.Compilation.
3.Hardware is Cable of processing and Executing Instructions.
4.Hardware doesn't Understand C-statements.
C-statements are Converted into assembly codes then it converts into the instructions.
1. It converts from High level language to Low Level Language.
2. It converts Human Understanble Language into Mechine Understandble Language.
3. Instructions Contains Opcodes and Operands.
4. Opcode: Is a Unique code that specifies the operation.
5. Operannds: Address of memory location in RAM.
Basic Units of Memory: Bits and Bytes
1.Bit : 0 or 1
2.8 bit: 1Byte
3. 16 Bit: 2 Bytes
4. 32 Bit : 4 Bytes
5. 64 Bits : 8 Bytes
RAM(Random Accesses Memory):
     1.RAM is divided into 4 Bytes.
     2. Every Byte of RAM will have Unique address.
     3. Address is in the form of Hexadecimal form.
     4. C language is easy to understand because it resembles English Language.
     5. ERRORS:
            1. Compile time Errors.
            2. Run Time Errors
     6. To find and reslove the compile time errors using COMPILERS.
     7. To find and reslove the run time errors using DEBUGGER.
  
LOADERS:
      It uses the keil IDE tools in Windows OS.
      C-program will converts into the Instructions by using the Exectuable Files,Binary ,Hexa Files and Images.
LINUX ENVIRONMENT:
      1.Development tools by the Ubuntu OS.
      2. Linux is a open source and free of cost.
      3. Ubuntu OS we use the text Editor called as VI(Virtual Interface)
      4. The advance OS is VIM(Virtual Interface Improved).
      GUI = Graphical User Interface.
      CLI = Command Line Interface.
      5. commands should be in Special Applications and Terimal Applications.
      6. Once the open terimal Application the Bylinking cursor is called command promot.
      7.Open the vi exisiting file - vi sample.c
      8.Documentation for vi text editor $ man vi and $ vi --help.
      9.Compiler tool(GCC) and Debugger tool(GDB) and Loader(LDD).
